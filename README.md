This repo for those who knows what is focus stacking photographic technique.
It consists of two scripts:
* **pyfocusstackfo.py** - organize files from camera into folders: 1 folder = 1 future photo
* **photoshop_script_subfolders.js** - do focus stacking in Adobe Photoshop for many folders at once

I found workflow with this scripts excellent for ease, robust, quick and perfect-result focus stacking.  
What I have tried, in order of declining result photo quality: [Zerene], [Helicon Focus], [ChimpStackr], [Enfuse]. This much better.

## My experience

I shoot nature and can have **thousand of photos from single walk**, whith 5-10 photos in each stack, meaning ~100 focus stacks once. With this scripts, it takes an hour to get result. Hope Adobe will pay me sometimes.  

Photoshop stacking function works so well that you won't see the difference even with blurred or damaged photos inside of "stacking" photos. I tried some experiments with cleaning of *unsuccessful* photos, but saw no differences: with Photoshop, result at most depends on *successfull* photos. This ability especially important for me as I offen shoot without tripod and half of my photos are garbage.

I can't say this about any other software for focus stacking: one bad photo in most cases will broke the result. 

I use [CameraPixels](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/camerapixels-lite/id1125808205) iOS app on my iPhone SE 1st Gen in focus stacking mode. It takes photos with intervals 0-1 seconds.  
So, having `MAX_TIME_DELTA = 2 sec`, I get desired result almost always. 
Sometimes, of course, there could be photos taken close to each other ‚Äî but thanks to `MIN_STACK_LEN` setting, they probably will not fall into "stack".

## Details on the _.py_ script

This script is enhansed version of script found on 

#### How does it works

1. The script look for all the _.jpg_ files in folder and **sort them alphabetically** with python `sorted()` function. 
2. Iterating files from first to last, it looking at EXIF field `Date taken`. If neighbour files taken with interval less or equal `MAX_TIME_DELTA`, they added to "stack". If stack accumulates more than `MIN_STACK_LEN` files, this stack added to final list
3. If stack accumulates less files than `MIN_STACK_LEN`, files from this stack will left where they was without changes (magenta color on pic above)
4. If stack acuumulates more files than `LENGTH_STACK_WARNING` files, program will print warning message in console, but "stack" will managed as usual
5. After creating stack, files will be moved in new created folder. Folder names used: `{FIRST_FILE_IN_STACK}_to_{LAST_FILE_IN_STACK}`. This folders than go to Photoshop to create focus stacked images.
6. Now you can check folders to remove blurred, smoothed or out-of-focus photos. 

#### Path to jpgs
There is two modes to use `pyfocusstackfo.py` script:
* **without arguments**, as shown on pic above.  
  In this case script will look at current working directory
* **with `-l` argument** passed to command line, process would looking [like this](/docs/stacking-library.png).  
In this case you'll face interacive dialog, and ¬´library path¬ª saved in `PATH_LIBRARY_DEFAULT` will be added to your desired path automatically (if you press `Enter`). You'll have to only pass rest of the path (or `Enter` if ¬´library path¬ª _is_ desired path). This is handy if you have long and stable path to your photos and don't want to type `cd /home/photo/long_path` every time.

## Details on the _.js_ script

The very first version of `photoshop_script_subfolders.js`, provided focus stacking only for three files, was found in Adobe Community [Discussion], made by user *SuperMerlin*.  I add two functions:
- processing with arbitratry quantity of files
- looping on arbitrary quantity of subfolders, i.e. multiple focus stacking images

Be aware of:
1. Script **do not crop** resulting photos. If your photos have poor align, then result will have gray-filled areas on the photo edges. You'll have to crop them manually.
2. If there will be empty folders, script will fail.
